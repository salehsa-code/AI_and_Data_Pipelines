# Firewall Changes

The virtual networks within VDP are managed centrally by the cloud core team.
Any changes to the network infrastructure, including changes to the firewall
have to be ordered via ticket to VDP in ITSP (it is not possible to order FW
changes directly in Remedy). The full change request process is described
[here](https://vattenfall.sharepoint.com/sites/NMS-VITSMS/SitePages/Security%20in%20operational%20procedures.aspx#firewall-change-request).

## Process

A firewall change request form needs to be filled and added to the ticket. The
newest version of the form can be found in the process description (see above).
It is also linked in ITSP, when creating the ticket.

The request will be validated by the service desk and then assigned to the
network team for approval. Once the ticket is approved, it will be assigned to
the relevant group for implementation.

### Timeline

The process description offers no official timeline or afford. From experience,
the time to complete a firewall change varies depending on availability of the
network team and the complexity and risk assessment of the network exception.

A minimum of two days should be planned for *common* or low risk firewall
changes. For more complex / higher risk changes, a longer fulfillment time
should be planned.

## Firewall Change History

A list of existing firewall changes is kept on the *Data Kongs* Sharepoint
[here](https://vattenfall.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/OTITSharedPlanning/Shared%20Documents/100%20-%20Data%20Kong/Firewall%20Requests?csf=1&web=1&e=yemGk9).
