# New Dataproduct

This article describes what actions are required for the Access Management
Framework when a new dataproduct is created.

## DLH-WDAP Products

Access to DLH data through WDAP is managed in a similar way to WDAP data
products. To grant access to tables in the bronze or silver schemas to end
users, you can follow this process:

1. Write a Ticket through ITSP to the "Active Directory"-team, requesting...
   1. ... creation of the AD groups (as described in [AD Groups](#ad-groups)),
      attach the filled in excel file, described in under the headline "[Omada
      Roles](#omada-roles)"
   2. ... to forward the ticket to the IAM team, once the groups have been
      created
   3. ...creation of the Omada roles as specified by the attached excel file
   > According to SLA, the process of creating an Omada role can take up to two weeks

Here is some boilerplate for the ticket:
```text
Please create these AD Groups in the IAM catalogue
- group_a
- group_b

After creating the groups, please forward the ticket to the IAM team,
so the Omada roles can be created according to the attach Excel file.
```


**Wait for the creation of the groups**

1. Ask a Databricks Account Admin (David Achilles, Alexander FrÃ¶hlich, Cloud
   Core), to onboard the new groups to the Accountlevel SCIM
2. After the SCIM sync, grant permissions to the Unity Catalog objects, as
   required


## AD Groups

Order AD Groups

- AD groups can be ordered via ITSP. It is important to specify, that they are
    created in the `IAM` Catalogue
- Request AD groups for all required personas (e.g., `Reader` and
    `Contributor`). Examples for personas that might be required can be taken
    from the [Access Management](../Access-Management.md#personas) article.

## Omada Roles

Once the AD Groups are available, reach out to the Active Directory Team to
create the Omada Roles

- Jamila Karkour was very helpful in creating those
- A template to create new Omada roles can be taken from [the Data Kong Teams
    Team](https://vattenfall.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/OTITSharedPlanning/Shared%20Documents/100%20-%20Data%20Kong/Omada%20Requests?csf=1&web=1&e=yzDArX).

## Azure DevOps

For AD groups that are required for access management within Azure DevOps, it is
required to onboard them to the DevOps Organization.

> Write an ITSP Ticket towards VDP (or know a Project Collection Admin)
