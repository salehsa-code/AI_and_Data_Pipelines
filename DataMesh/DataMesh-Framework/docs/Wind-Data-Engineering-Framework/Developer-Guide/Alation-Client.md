# Alation Client

Alation exists in two environments,  [PRD](https://adc.corp.vattenfall.com/) and
[TST](https://adc-test.corp.vattenfall.com/) . Developments are done on the TST
system. The users on the TST system are application native, so every developer
has to have a user created. This can be done by reaching out to a system
administrator. System Owner is Sebastian Kaus, but currently also David Achilles
and Mattias SÃ¶derholm can help with this kind of requests for the TST system.

> The account must be created in this format:
> <first_name>.<last_name>@vattenfall.com

:warning: The TST instance of Alation is shutdown over night and only started on request.
If you need it, reach out to Sebastian Kaus.
