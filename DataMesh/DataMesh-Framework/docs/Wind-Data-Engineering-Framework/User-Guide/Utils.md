# Utils

This group of modules defines utility tools to support data engineering tasks.

Modules:

- [Logging](./Utils/Logging.md): Logging utilities, e.g. Log Analytics Handler.
- [Session](./Utils/Session.md): Abstractions for Databricks Sessions and DBUtils.

> Usually having `utils` in a framework is a code smell. However, in this case
> it is a conscious decision to group all utility modules under a common
> namespace.
