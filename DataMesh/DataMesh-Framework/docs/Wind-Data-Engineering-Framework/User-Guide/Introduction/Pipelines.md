# Pipelines

Pipelines are a key concept in WinDEF. They are a sequence of actions that are
executed in a specific order. Each action in a pipeline is a step that performs
a specific task. The output of one action can be used as the input for the next
action. This allows you to build complex data processing workflows.

Please find the documentation on pipelines [here](../Pipeline/).
