## Overview

The Wind Data Engineering Framework (often referred to as _WinDEF_ or "the
framework" in this documentation) is a tool that aims for the integration of
data engineering solutions in a single place. Think of it as a collection of
tested code that helps you run pipelines or solve certain problems. Just use
what you need and contribute what you think might help others.

You can either uses the code directly or take it as inspiration for you own data
engineering tasks. (If you decide to not use the offered code even though it
matches your problem, please let us know where it falls short so that it can be
improved). If you develop a solution that might help others as well then [please
contribute](./Wind-Data-Engineering-Framework/Developer-Guide.md)!
